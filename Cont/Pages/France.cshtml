		<h1>EIFEL TOWER</h1>
		<p>
			<strong>The Eiffel Tower</strong>, an iconic symbol of France and one of the most recognizable landmarks in the world, stands majestically in the heart of Paris. Built between 1887 and 1889 as the centerpiece for the 1889 Exposition Universelle, the tower was designed by engineer Gustave Eiffel and initially met with mixed reactions from critics and Parisians. Today, it is celebrated as a masterpiece of engineering and a global symbol of art and innovation. Rising to a height of 330 meters (1,083 feet) including its antenna, the Eiffel Tower was the tallest man-made structure in the world until the completion of the Chrysler Building in 1930. Constructed from wrought iron, the tower is divided into three levels accessible to the public, offering panoramic views of Paris, along with restaurants, shops, and exhibits. At night, the tower sparkles with 20,000 lights, enchanting visitors with its dazzling illuminations. Over the years, it has hosted millions of tourists and served as a backdrop for countless cultural, political, and social events. Representing both the industrial age and the romantic allure of Paris, the Eiffel Tower remains a symbol of France's creativity and enduring charm, attracting over 7 million visitors annually.
