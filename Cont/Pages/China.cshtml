		<h1>THE GREAT WALL</h1>
		<p>
			<strong>THE GREAT WALL</strong>, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most iconic landmarks in the world, stretches over 21,000 kilometers (13,000 miles) across northern China. Originally constructed to protect Chinese states and empires from invasions, its history spans over 2,000 years, with sections built during different dynasties, most notably the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). The wall is not a single continuous structure but a series of walls and fortifications made from materials like earth, wood, bricks, and stone, depending on the region. Towering watchtowers, fortresses, and gates along the wall were strategically placed for surveillance and defense. Beyond its military function, the Great Wall symbolized China’s strength and unity and served as a vital trade route, contributing to cultural exchanges along the Silk Road. Popular sections like Badaling and Mutianyu near Beijing attract millions of visitors annually, offering stunning views of the surrounding landscapes and a glimpse into ancient engineering marvels. The Great Wall stands as a testament to human ingenuity and determination, continuing to inspire awe and curiosity while representing China’s rich history and enduring cultural legacy.
