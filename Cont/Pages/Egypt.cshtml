		<h1>EGYPT</h1>
		<p>
			<strong>Egypt</strong>, officially known as the Arab Republic of Egypt, is a unique transcontinental country located in the northeastern corner of Africa and the southwestern corner of Asia. It is connected by the Sinai Peninsula, which serves as a bridge between the two continents. To the north, Egypt is bordered by the Mediterranean Sea, providing access to key trade routes and a rich maritime history. The eastern border is defined by the Red Sea, while to the south, Egypt shares a boundary with Sudan, and to the west, it is bordered by Libya. In the northeast, the country shares borders with Palestine and Israel. The Gulf of Aqaba in the northeast acts as a natural separation between Egypt and the nations of Jordan and Saudi Arabia.

			Cairo, the nation’s capital, is the largest city and a cultural and political hub, steeped in history and modern significance. Alexandria, the second-largest city, lies along the Mediterranean coast and plays a vital role as an industrial and tourism center, blending historical landmarks with modern developments. With a population of approximately 110 million people, Egypt ranks as the 14th most populous country in the world and the third most populous in Africa. The country’s strategic location, rich history, and cultural heritage make it a central player in the region, connecting continents and civilizations through centuries.

			<strong>The Pyramids of Egypt</strong>, iconic symbols of ancient Egyptian civilization, are among the most famous architectural wonders in the world. Located on the Giza Plateau near Cairo, the three Great Pyramids—Khufu (also known as the Great Pyramid), Khafre, and Menkaure—stand as enduring testaments to the engineering and artistic prowess of the ancient Egyptians. The Great Pyramid of Khufu, the largest and oldest of the three, is the last remaining wonder of the ancient world and was originally built as a tomb for the Pharaoh Khufu around 2600 BCE. These monumental structures were constructed with massive limestone and granite blocks, precisely aligned to the cardinal points of the compass, reflecting advanced knowledge of astronomy and mathematics. Surrounding the pyramids are smaller pyramids, temples, and the famous Great Sphinx, a limestone statue with a lion's body and a human head, believed to represent Pharaoh Khafre. The pyramids are not only marvels of construction but also repositories of ancient religious and cultural practices, as they were designed to honor the pharaohs and ensure their safe journey to the afterlife. Today, the Pyramids of Giza attract millions of tourists annually and continue to captivate archaeologists and historians, offering a glimpse into the grandeur and mysteries of ancient Egypt.
